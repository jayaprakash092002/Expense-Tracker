The Expense Tracker is a beginner-friendly Python project designed to help users record and analyze daily expenses directly from the command line. It allows users to input categories, amounts, and optional notes, and automatically saves these records to a CSV file.

The project uses Python’s built-in csv and datetime libraries to manage data storage and track when each expense was recorded. For summary and analysis features, it uses pandas to display total spending for today, this week, and the current month, making it easy for users to monitor their financial habits.

This project showcases key Python skills including:

File handling

Date and time management

Data analysis with pandas

Interactive menu-driven applications

It’s a simple yet practical tool for improving coding skills while building something useful. Ideal for students, beginners, and anyone looking to start using Python for real-world applications.
